## Objective

Create and run unit tests for isolated functions and rules.

## When to use

- Pure helpers or utilities need coverage
- Business rules are isolated from IO

## Scope

Does:

- Test pure behavior
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and failures

Does not:

- Cover cross-layer behavior
- Replace integration or E2E tests

## Workflow

1. Identify the unit and its behavior
2. Add focused cases
3. Run the targeted test command
4. Report results and gaps
