## Objective

Understand the current state and decide the next sensible step.

## Use for

- Unknown repositories or unclear requests
- Scoping a feature, bug, or refactor before execution
- Mapping constraints, risks, invariants, and affected areas
- Producing a plan, backlog proposal, or acceptance criteria

## Does

- Read only the relevant repo context
- Summarize the current shape of the system
- Identify gaps, risks, and likely next steps
- Optionally persist outputs such as a PRD or backlog

## Ralph TUI PRD Notes

When the requested output is a PRD for `ralph-tui`, do not emit a generic analysis JSON.
Use the JSON tracker schema expected by `ralph-tui run --prd <path>`:

```json
{
  "name": "PRD name",
  "description": "PRD summary",
  "branchName": "target-branch",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Story title",
      "description": "User-facing or developer-facing outcome",
      "acceptanceCriteria": ["..."],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": "optional implementation notes",
      "dependsOn": []
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "updatedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `userStories` is the task source; missing it causes `No tasks loaded`
- Each story must include at least `id`, `title`, `description`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `priority`, `passes`, and `dependsOn`
- Prefer one PRD file with multiple ordered stories over a meta-PRD that nests several unrelated PRD objects
- Convert analysis output into executable stories with explicit dependencies and acceptance criteria
- When telling the user how to run it, prefer `ralph-tui run --prd ./relative/path/to/prd.json`
- Avoid commands like `ralph-tui docs ...` during investigation because they may open the user's browser

## Does not

- Implement code
- Debug a reproduced failure end-to-end
- Give final merge approval
- Do architecture sustainability review as its main task

## Workflow

1. Read the request and current context
2. Map only the relevant code and docs
3. Name the problem, constraints, and unknowns
4. Propose the next step with a small, explicit scope
5. Emit the lightest useful output: scan, plan, backlog, or acceptance criteria
